# Local-Anesthesia-MRD
Code for a website to calculate Maximum Recommended Dose(MRD) of Local Anesthesia (LA) used in Dentistry.It is based on the patient's weight and absolute maximum.
It is only 'one' of the ways to avoid LA overdose. Please use clinical discernment, experience, and knowledge of the subject matter.
All the MRD of LA based on weight is in 'milligram' and 'with vasoconstrictor '
Both MRD of LA-based on weight and absolute maximum is as per FDA guidelines and as mentioned in the textbook "Hand book of Local Anesthesia" by Stanely H Malamed, 7thedition.
MRDs used for the calculation: (with epinephrine) MRD for Lidocaine & Articaine = 500mg of LA , Mepivacaine = 400mg, Prilocaine = 600mg, Bupivacaine = 90mg

MRD calculated based on weight will never exceed the absolute maximum mg given for each LA mentioned above. Therefore, after a certain weight, MRD based on weight will remain the same i.e Absolute Maximum Value. This cutoff weight is not exact (due to roundoff) but is a tentative value.

If you want calculate MRD based on weight for each LA:(with epinephrine) use:
Lidocaine & Articaine = 7mg/kg 
Mepivacaine = 6.6mg/kg 
Prilocaine = 8mg/kg 
Bupivacine = 2mg/kg
